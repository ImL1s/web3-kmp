> Configure project :
w: The following Kotlin/Native targets cannot be built on this machine and are disabled:
iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64, iosX64, macosArm64, macosX64, watchosArm64, watchosSimulatorArm64, watchosX64
To hide this message, add 'kotlin.native.ignoreDisabledTargets=true' to the Gradle properties.

w: The Default Kotlin Hierarchy Template was not applied to 'root project 'bitcoin-kmp'':
Explicit .dependsOn() edges were configured for the following source sets:
[iosArm64Main, iosMain, iosSimulatorArm64Main, iosX64Main, watchosArm64Main, watchosMain, watchosSimulatorArm64Main, watchosX64Main]

Consider removing dependsOn-calls or disabling the default template by adding
    'kotlin.mpp.applyDefaultHierarchyTemplate=false'
to your gradle.properties
