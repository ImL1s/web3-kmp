> Configure project :kotlin-utxo
w: The Default Kotlin Hierarchy Template was not applied to 'project ':kotlin-utxo'':

[androidMain, iosArm64Main, iosMain, iosSimulatorArm64Main, iosX64Main, jvmMain, watchosArm64Main, watchosMain, watchosSimulatorArm64Main]

Consider removing dependsOn-calls or disabling the default template by adding
